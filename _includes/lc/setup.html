### Spreadsheets

Spreadsheets are useful for data entry and data organization, and some
subsetting and sorting of the data as well as getting an overview of the
data. To interact with spreadsheets, we can use
[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org), [Microsoft
Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel),
[Gnumeric](http://www.gnumeric.org),
[OpenOffice.org](https://www.openoffice.org), or other programs.
Commands may differ a bit between programs, but general ideas for
thinking about spreadsheets is the same.

For this lesson, if you don't have a spreadsheet program already, you
can use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org). It's a free, open
source spreadsheet program.

Notes:
* When you download OpenRefine for Windows or Linux from the address above, you are downloading a zip file. To install OpenRefine you unzip the downloaded file wherever you want to install the program. This can be to a personal directory or to an applications or software directory - OpenRefine should run wherever you put the unzipped folder. The location has to be a "local" drive as problems have been reported trying to run OpenRefine from a Network drive.
* OpenRefine is a Java application, and you need to have a 'Java Runtime Environment' (JRE) installed on your computer to run OpenRefine. Version 3.4 of OpenRefine for Windows has a version with embedded Java which you can use without doing a separate installation if the Java Runtime Environment.  If you are on Linux, or use Windows and do not want to use OpenRefine with embedded Java, and you donâ€™t already have the Java Runtime Environment installed, then you can download and install from [http://java.com](http://java.com) by going to the site and clicking "Free Java Download".
